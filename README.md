## Getting Started

In the main page of the website the user will be able to input their name, recipe name, an image for the recipe, followed by ingredients and instructions for the recipe. Once this information is submitted it will create a recipe block on the linked page that will display the collected recipe's from users. 

A trello board was used to keep track of development progress and can be viewed [here](https://trello.com/b/7AUGTiss/recipe-board).
